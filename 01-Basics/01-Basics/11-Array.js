Concatenate Elements Into New Array
Concatenate means to join two things in succession.

The concat() method creates a new array that contains elements from the array on which concat is invoked followed by the arguments passed. If the argument is an array, the elements of the array will be inserted into the new array.
  const evenNumbers = [2, 4, 6];
const oddNumbers = [1, 3, 5];
const numbers = evenNumbers.concat(oddNumbers);
console.log(numbers);
