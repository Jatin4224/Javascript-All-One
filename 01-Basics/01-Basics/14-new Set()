Set is a collection of unique values. It can store values of any type.
const fruits = new Set(["apple", "orange", "mango"]);
console.log(fruits);



Sets are very similar to Arrays. One main difference between Sets and Arrays is that a Set can only contain unique values. Arrays can have duplicate elements.
const fruits = new Set(["apple", "orange", "mango", "apple", "grape"]);
console.log(fruits);
