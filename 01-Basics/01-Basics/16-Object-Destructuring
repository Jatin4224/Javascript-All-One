Object Destructuring
Object destructuring allows us to copy the value of properties of objects and store them in other variables.

example-
const person = {
  fullName: "Adam Smith",
  age: 37,
  isAdmin: true
};

const { age, fullName, isAdmin } = person;
console.log(`${fullName} is ${age} years old. Are they an admin? ${isAdmin}.`);

Renaming Destructured Property
Consider the following example:
const fruit = {
  name: "apple",
  color: "red",
}

const animal = {
  name: "horse",
  color: "brown",
}

const { name, color } = fruit;
const { name, color } = animal;

n the example given above, we have two objects fruit and animal with keys of the same names name and color. When destructuring these objects and storing the values in separate variables we get an error because we cannot have two variables named name as well as two variables named color.

We can use a colon : to specify another name for the variable in which the value of a property from a destructured object is stored.

Let's rewrite the above example:
const fruit = {
  name: "apple",
  color: "red",
}

const animal = {
  name: "horse",
  color: "brown",
}

const { name: fruitName, color: fruitColor } = fruit;
const { name: animalName, color: animalColor } = animal;

console.log(`The ${animalColor} ${animalName} eats a ${fruitColor} ${fruitName}`);




The ability to rename destructured properties is useful in cases where the key name of an object is not a valid variable name, as shown in the example given below:
example-
const user = {
  "full-name": "Sam Smith",
}

const { "full-name" } = user;
we get an error because "full-name" is not a valid variable name. So we need to rename the destructured property to a valid variable name

const user = {
  "full-name": "Sam Smith",
}

const { "full-name": fullName } = user;
console.log(fullName);


Destructuring with Computed Properties
Consider the following example:

const person = {
  12: "Adam",
  13: "Samantha"
};

const keyName = 12;
const { [keyName]: twelfthPerson } = person;

console.log(twelfthPerson);

Note that we renamed the destructured property because 12 is not a valid variable name.

Similarly, we can also destructure properties using expressions
example-
const person = {
  12: "Adam",
  13: "Samantha"
};

const { [3 * 4]: twelfthPerson } = person; // Same as { 12: twelfthPerson } = person

console.log(twelfthPerson);

The Rest Pattern
exaxmple-
const person = {
  name: "Adam Smith",
  email: "adam@example.com",
  phone: "911234567890"
};

const { name, ...contactInfo } = person;
console.log(name);
console.log(contactInfo);


NOTE-The rest operator must always come last. Otherwise it will cause an error.

/////Named Parameters//////////

const getBalance = ({income, expense = 0, tax = 0}) => {
  console.log(income - (expense + tax))
};


const updated = {
  income: 100000,
  tax: 3000
}
getBalance(updated)
